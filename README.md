## ðŸ”‘ **Core Redux Toolkit Terminologies**

### 1. **Redux Toolkit (RTK)**

Redux Toolkit is the official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development. It simplifies Redux by reducing boilerplate code and includes utilities for common use cases like store setup, reducers, and middleware configuration.........

### 2. **Store**

The store is a centralized container that holds the entire state of the application. In Redux Toolkit, the `configureStore` function is used to create the store with good default settings, including built-in support for Redux DevTools and middleware like Redux Thunk. 

### 3. **Slice**

A slice represents a portion of the Redux state and contains the reducer logic and actions for that specific part. The `createSlice` function in Redux Toolkit allows you to define reducers and generate corresponding actions automatically.&#x20;

### 4. **Reducer**

Reducers are pure functions that determine how the state should change in response to actions. In Redux Toolkit, reducers are typically defined within slices, and the `createSlice` function handles the creation of action types and action creators.&#x20;

### 5. **Action**

Actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe an intention to change the state. Each action must have a `type` property. Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` automatically generates action creators for the reducers you define.&#x20;

### 6. **Middleware**

Middleware in Redux intercepts dispatched actions before they reach the reducer. Redux Toolkit includes Redux Thunk by default, which allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action, enabling asynchronous logic like API calls.&#x20;

### 7. **Thunk**

A thunk is a function that wraps an expression to delay its evaluation. In Redux, thunks are used to handle asynchronous operations. Redux Toolkit simplifies the use of thunks by including Redux Thunk middleware by default.&#x20;

### 8. **Selector**

Selectors are functions that extract specific pieces of data from the Redux store. They help in encapsulating the logic for retrieving and computing derived data from the state.&#x20;

### 9. **Immer**

Immer is a library that allows you to work with immutable state in a more convenient way. Redux Toolkit uses Immer under the hood, enabling you to write "mutating" logic in reducers, which is then safely converted into immutable updates.&#x20;

### 10. **createAsyncThunk**

`createAsyncThunk` is a utility provided by Redux Toolkit to handle asynchronous operations. It generates action creators and action types for pending, fulfilled, and rejected states of an async request, streamlining the process of handling async logic in Redux.&#x20;

## ðŸ§  **Key Concepts and Principles**

* **Single Source of Truth**: The entire state of the application is stored in a single store, making it easier to manage and debug. 

* **State is Read-Only**: The only way to change the state is by dispatching actions, ensuring predictable state transitions.
* **Changes are Made with Pure Functions**: Reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action as arguments and return a new state.

## ðŸ’¼ **Real-World Scenarios**

* **Asynchronous Data Fetching**: Using `createAsyncThunk` to handle API calls, managing loading, success, and error states seamlessly.

* **Modular State Management**: Breaking down the state into slices for different features or domains, promoting scalability and maintainability.

* **Optimistic Updates**: Implementing immediate UI updates while an async operation is in progress, then reconciling with the actual result.
